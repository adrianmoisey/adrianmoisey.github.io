<h1>Hello. I'm Adrian.</h1>
<p>
I'm an Operations Engineer living in Cape Town, South Africa.
</p>

<p>
I love all things DevOps, and try make sure I surround myself with as much of it as possible.
I live and work in Cape Town, playing with the latest technology, like Docker and Kubernetes.
I have a passion for automating as much as possible, mostly because I'm lazy and would prefer a computer to do the task
for me.
</p>

<h2>Some of the things I do...</h2>

<h3>Cape Town DevOps Meetup</h3>
<p>
I'm one of the organisers of the <a href="https://meetup.com/Cape-Town-DevOps">Cape Town DevOps Meetup</a> group.
Our group has been running since June 2015, with a variety of local and international speakers.
</p>

<h3>DevOpsDays Cape Town</h3>
<p>
I'm on the team of people who brought <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-cape-town/welcome/">DevOpsDays</a>
to Cape Town in 2016.
We managed to pull together speakers from all over the globe, all of whom gave excellent talks to our Capetonian
audience.
</p>

<h3>Bass guitar</h3>
<p>
One of my non-DevOps hobbies is to play the bass guitar. I own a small selection of Leo Fender made basses.
